# Earth - the orbitless planet
In the year 3017, some alien species appears because their solar system was destroyed.
And they found out our solar system - the perfect place for them to build their new home.
So they place their planet in the earth's orbit and kick the earth out of the solar system.
In this game you have to control the earth to fly orbitlessly throught 9 planets, fight the alien
and retrieve the earth's lost orbit.

- There are totaly 9 planets (the sun is counted).
- Use the mouse to control the the earth, hold left mouse or hold space bar to fire.
- Catch powerup to upgrade your gun.
- You can continue from the previous planet you have visited after you die with the same gun set,
but your lives and scores are reseted.
